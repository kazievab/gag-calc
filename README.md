* Install [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition)
* Clone repository
* Open repository in IDE

ðŸ“” If a build in IntelliJ IDE fails at
[java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "yarn"](https://github.com/ScalablyTyped/SlinkyDemos/issues/12),
then you need to close the IDE and then open it in the console using the `open -na "<Name of Intellij on your system>"`,
for example `open -na "IntelliJ IDEA.app"` or paste `open -na "Intel` into the console and press Tab.

## Prepare

Before doing anything, including before importing in an IDE, run
```
npm install
```

## Development

Open two terminals. In the first one, start sbt and, within, continuously build the Scala.js project:

```
sbt dev
```

In the second one, start the Vite (via Turbo) development server with

```
turbo dev
```

Follow the URL presented to you by Turbo to open the application.

## Production build

Make a production build with

```
turbo build
```

You can then find the built files in the `dist/` directory.
